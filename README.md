# hello-world
My first repository

Hello,

My name is Quinten and I am a sophmore studying urban planning and geography.
I took Comp Sci to earn a credit towards a GIS minor and also because my friend Carter reccommended it.
My favorite hobby is long distance running. I hope to join the WCU cross country team once campus opens back up.
